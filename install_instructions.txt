Instructions for Linux (Similar instructions will work on other platforms too):
* Go to https://www.anaconda.com and locate package to download
* wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
* bash Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
	** Yes to conda init (Adds to .bashrc)
* source ~/.bashrc
* git clone https://github.com/bjcosta/sonar.git
* cd sonar
* conda env update --file environment.yml
* conda activate sonar
* python src/gen_images.py data/small.sl2

You should be able to find images rendering the content of the small.sl2 file under data/small.sl2.*

NOTE: There is currently a bug I have looked into for Linux where it is generating a .html file instead of a png for the depth image
